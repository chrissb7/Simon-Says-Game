# Simon-Says-Game
Simon Says Game a memory based game. Based on watching a number of coloured buttons light up/change tone in order. Then pressing the buttons in the same sequential order they were lit up.

The purpose of this project was to explore JavaScript timing events coupled with event listeners. The simon says game was a project that allowed me to learn these aspects of JavaScript.
